# How to use this?
Check help.md
# For developer
Resources are in https://github.com/yt6983138/PSLDiscordBot_Resources <br/>
You can add your custom command by adding function in Dictionary Commands in Program.cs, please see following example:
```c#
// look at CommandBase.cs for more info
// attribute to add to global command, without this command wont be added
[AddToGlobal]
public class HelpCommand : // CommandBase or GuestCommandBase or AdminCommandBase, depends on comand type
{
	public override OneOf<string, LocalizedString> PSLName=> /* command name, string or localization */;
	public override OneOf<string, LocalizedString> PSLDescription => /* command description, string or localization */;

	public override SlashCommandBuilder CompleteBuilder =>
		this.BasicBuilder;
	// use .AddOption to add option and add other things

	public override async Task Callback(
		SocketSlashCommand arg, 
		UserData? data, 
		DataBaseService.DbDataRequester requester, 
		object executer)
	{
		// actual callback, note you do not need arg.DeferAsync, already did that in Execute
	}
}
```
When you publish: <br/>
This is a cross platform project, just remember do not compile with "trim unused code", it will break json things. <br/>
Also, remember to install `Saira` and `Saira ExtraCondensed` fonts (otherwise it will use whatever font the system has).
